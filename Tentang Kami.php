                      <h2>Reason why we created this website</h2>
                      <p>
                        In overcoming the problems in the school canteen, our PBL project is an integrated canteen which aims to be a solution to these problems. This system allows students to use the school canteen but still obeys health protocols and controls the number of students who come to the canteen so that there is no crowd in the school canteen. The system used uses IoT (Internet of Things) so that students can order food in the canteen online through the application and students only need to take the ordered food.
